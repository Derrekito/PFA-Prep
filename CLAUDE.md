# PFA Planning System

## Overview
This system generates a comprehensive Physical Fitness Assessment (PFA) training plan using configurable parameters to create calendar entries for workouts, meals, and supplements. The system supports progressive training, flexible meal planning, and customizable eating windows.

## Configuration Format
**Recommendation: Migrate from JSON to YAML** for better readability and comments support.

## System Functions

### 1. Fitness Progression Calculator
- **Linear Progression**: Calculates weekly improvements based on baselineâ†’goal over specified weeks
- **Buffer Integration**: Adjusts timeline to meet goals X weeks before test date
- **Plateau Detection**: Identifies when progress stalls and suggests modifications
- **Standards Validation**: Ensures goals meet or exceed PFA minimums

### 2. Calorie & Macro Calculator
- **Manual Calorie Setting**: Uses user-specified daily calorie target
- **Macro Distribution**: Converts percentages to gram targets based on calorie goal

### 3. Advanced Meal Plan Generator
- **Structured Meal Database**: Uses separate YAML database (`configs/meal_database.yml`) with detailed food metadata
- **Intelligent Meal Combinations**: Combines proteins, carbs, vegetables, and fruits based on meal type requirements
- **Multiple Options Per Meal**: Generates 3 distinct meal options per meal type per day (9+ options daily)
- **Time-Restricted Eating**: Respects eating windows (e.g., 11am-7pm) with override capability
- **Day-Specific Configuration**: Different meal counts for weekdays (2 meals) vs weekends (3 meals)
- **Weekend Preferences**: Enhanced breakfast options for weekend meals when more time is available
- **Macro Precision**: Each meal option includes detailed macronutrient breakdown and calorie counts
- **Exclusion Rules**: Prevents conflicting food combinations (e.g., eggs vs boiled eggs)
- **Portion Control**: Precise portion sizes for accurate macro calculations

### 4. Supplement Scheduler
- **Timing Optimization**: Schedules supplements for maximum efficacy
- **Interaction Awareness**: Prevents conflicting supplement timing
- **Training Day Logic**: Different stacks for training vs. rest days
- **Reminder Integration**: Calendar alerts for supplement times

### 5. Workout Progression Engine
- **Auto-Scaling**: Adjusts workout intensity based on progress
- **Periodization**: Incorporates easy/hard week cycles
- **Component Balancing**: Ensures all PFA elements get adequate attention
- **Recovery Integration**: Schedules rest days and deload weeks

### 6. Advanced Calendar Integration
- **ICS Export**: Generates .ics calendar files compatible with all major calendar applications
- **Separate Calendar Files**: Generates distinct .ics files for workouts, meals, and supplements
- **Multiple Meal Options**: Creates separate calendar events for each meal option (3 per meal type)
- **Time Staggering**: Meal options are staggered by 5-minute intervals for easy selection
- **Detailed Event Descriptions**: Each event includes full ingredient lists, portions, and macro breakdowns
- **Smart Reminders**: Configurable reminder timing with string-to-integer parsing
- **Progress Tracking**: Includes fields for logging actual performance
- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify individual events without rebuilding

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Generate your plan (auto-setup on first run)
./run_pfa_plan.sh my_plan.yml
```

All configuration options (start date, weeks, formats, output directory, etc.) are specified in the YAML config file itself. The shell script handles virtual environment setup and activation automatically.

## Shell Scripts

### run_pfa_plan.sh
All-in-one script that handles environment setup and plan generation:
```bash
./run_pfa_plan.sh [options] config_file.yml
```
- **First run**: Creates `venvs/main/` virtual environment and installs dependencies
- **Subsequent runs**: Activates existing virtual environment
- Calls `python generate_pfa_plan.py` with all passed arguments
- Provides colored output and error handling
- No separate setup step required

## Development Workflow

The project includes a knowledge graph system to help with development and code understanding:

### 1. Graph Service Setup
```bash
# Ensure Neo4j is running on bolt://localhost:7687
# Default credentials: neo4j/password

# Start the graph API service (creates lightweight venv under venvs/graph/)
./scripts/run-graph.sh
```

### 2. Populate Knowledge Graph
```bash
# Extract project structure and relationships into Neo4j
python extract_graph.py
```
This script analyzes the codebase and creates nodes for:
- Python modules and their relationships
- Function definitions and dependencies
- Configuration files and parameters

### 3. Query Development Context
```bash
# Query the graph via REST API
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/graph/query \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"cypher":"MATCH (f:Function)-[:DEFINED_IN]->(m:Module) RETURN f.fqname, m.path LIMIT 5"}'
```

This development approach keeps investigations grounded in the current repository state and helps agents understand code relationships without loading unrelated files.

## Meal Database System

The system uses a separate structured meal database (`configs/meal_database.yml`) with detailed food metadata:

### Database Structure
```yaml
proteins:
  - name: "Grilled chicken breast"
    portion: "4oz (115g)"
    calories: 185
    protein: 35
    carbs: 0
    fat: 4
    meal_types: ["lunch", "dinner"]
    tags: ["lean", "versatile"]
    exclusions: ["fried_chicken"]
    prep_time: 15

carbs:
  - name: "Brown rice"
    portion: "1/2 cup cooked"
    calories: 110
    protein: 3
    carbs: 22
    fat: 1
    meal_types: ["lunch", "dinner"]
    tags: ["fiber", "whole_grain"]
    exclusions: ["white_rice", "quinoa"]
    prep_time: 25

meal_generation:
  options_per_meal: 3
  combination_rules:
    breakfast:
      required_components: ["proteins"]
      optional_components: ["carbs", "fruits"]
      min_protein: 15
      target_calories: [300, 450]
```

### Meal Generation Features
- **Component-Based Assembly**: Intelligently combines proteins + vegetables + carbs + fruits
- **Meal Type Appropriateness**: Each food item specifies which meals it's suitable for
- **Nutritional Requirements**: Minimum protein and calorie ranges per meal type
- **Exclusion Logic**: Prevents conflicting combinations (e.g., brown rice + white rice)
- **Weekend Preferences**: Special handling for weekend meals with more elaborate options
